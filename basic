# Sound Objects

# similar mechanisms to squirrel: moving camera, playerObj, obstacleObj, soundObjs

# each sound object collided with triggers a sample in sonic pi
# objective of game is to touch enough objects to complete the composition
# while avoiding obstacles

# if obstacles are hit, this will affect the sound/params/trigger samples to stop
# trigger parameters such as sleep value/rate/amp?
# recover from obstacles and continue trying to complete composition

# to further work on:
# two different shapes/colors of obj related to two preconcieved compositions
# can eat one or both, will affect the sound that is produced
# two compositions can also work simultaneously, will contrast somehow?
