Building a computer game and interactive composition with Pygame and Sonic Pi

This project involves a computer game built with Pygame, combined with an interactive composition coded in Sonic Pi. By communicating with OSC messages, events in the game will trigger sound events in Sonic Pi.

Building upon code from "Making Games with Python and Pygame" by Al Sweigart, the game follows the simple premise of catching objects and avoiding obstacles. The sound can be thought of as a composition controlled by the game state mapped to player health. As health increases, new sounds are added. If the player hits obstacles, or health decreases, those sounds get distorted. By recovering, the player will restore the sounds to their original state.

Achieving the maximum health will complete the composition.

To get started, copy the sonic_pi_game_sound file into a new buffer in Sonic Pi. Update the directory variable with your computer's file path. Run the buffer. Open the game_sound file and run. Enjoy the game.
